        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) tube refrigerated crescent rolls, such as Pillsbury</li>
            <li>8 breakfast sausage links, cooked, such as Farmer Johns</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
         <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F 180 degrees C</p>

         <h4>Step 2</h4>
         <p>Whisk eggs and milk together in a bowl  until combined. Melt butter 
            in a skillet over medium heat. Add egg mixture and cook, stirring 
            constantly, until eggs are set, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</p>

         <h4>Step 3</h4>
         <p>Unroll crescent roll dough and separate into 8 triangles. Add 1 tablespoon 
            scrambled egg and 1 sausage to the wide end of a crescent roll. Roll up to 
            enclose contents; place on an ungreased baking sheet. Repeat with remaining 
            ingredients.</p>

         <h4>Step 4</h4>
         <p>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 13 to 16 minutes.</p>
